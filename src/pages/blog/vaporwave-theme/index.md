I use vscode daily for my work and personal projects and I always wanted to give it a little bit of a custom accent

There are beautiful themes out there for it already, but I could never find one that I was able to stick with in the long run

I am particularly fond of the Snazzy colors on iTerm2

    <i style="color: var(--dark-color-lighter)">snazzy</i>
</p>

I also love the work done on both [<u>Horizon</u>](https://horizontheme.netlify.com/) and [<u>Synthwave</u>](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) themes

The only thing that bottered me on all of those themes is that they all seem to abuse the red color, I wanted something with less red but that still had that [<u>altered carbon</u>](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series)>) kinda vibe

So I decided to give it a try and start customizing a theme of my own and [<u>vaporwave</u>](https://vaporwave-theme.netlify.com/) was born!

Here's a nice little preview of how it looks like

Feel free to grab it from the extensions [<u>marketplace</u>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=this-fifo.vaporwave-theme-vscode) and give me feedback or suggestions in the [<u>github</u>](https://github.com/this-fifo/vaporwave-theme-vscode/) repo

I encourage everyone to go and try customizing vscode to your liking, it's quite easy and there are very good resources out there as well
